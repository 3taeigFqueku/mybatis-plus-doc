If you have a Cisco 1921 router and you want to enable some advanced features such as SSL VPN, IPsec VPN, or BGP routing, you will need to install and activate a datak9 license. This license is part of the Cisco IOS Software Technology Package License, which allows you to upgrade your router's functionality without changing the hardware.
  
In this article, we will show you how to install and activate a datak9 license on your Cisco 1921 router using a keygen tool. This tool can generate a valid license key for your router based on its serial number and feature set. You can download the tool from [here](https://geags.com/2qnlxn).

First, insert the USB flash drive into your computer and create a text file named datak9.lic. Paste the license key into the file and save it.
  
Then, insert the USB flash drive into your router's USB port and enter the following commands in the router's CLI:

    Router# copy usbflash0:datak9.lic flash0:datak9.lic
    Router# show flash0:

You should see the datak9.lic file in your router's flash memory.

## How to Verify the Datak9 License
  
After you install and activate the datak9 license on your Cisco 1921 router, you may want to verify that the license is working properly and that the features are enabled. You can do this by using some show commands in the router's CLI.
  
For example, to verify that the SSL VPN feature is enabled, you can enter the following command:

    Router# show webvpn gateway

You should see some information about the SSL VPN gateway configuration and status. If the SSL VPN feature is not enabled, you will see an error message saying "SSL VPN is not enabled on this device".
  
Similarly, to verify that the IPsec VPN feature is enabled, you can enter the following command:

    Router# show crypto ipsec sa

You should see some information about the IPsec security associations and traffic statistics. If the IPsec VPN feature is not enabled, you will see an error message saying "There are no ipsec sas".
  
Finally, to verify that the BGP routing feature is enabled, you can enter the following command:

    Router# show ip bgp summary

You should see some information about the BGP neighbors and routes. If the BGP routing feature is not enabled, you will see an error message saying "BGP not active".
  
## How to Troubleshoot the Datak9 License
  
If you encounter any problems with the datak9 license on your Cisco 1921 router, such as the license key being invalid or expired, or the features not working as expected, you can try some troubleshooting steps to resolve them.
  
First, you can check the license status and details by entering the following command:

    Router# show license detail datak9

You should see some information about the license type, duration, status, usage count, and expiration date. If there is any problem with the license key or activation, you will see an error message indicating the cause of the problem.
  
Second, you can try to reinstall and reactivate the license by entering the following commands:

    Router# license clear datak9
    Router# license install flash0:datak9.lic
    Router# show license

This will remove and reinstall the datak9 license on your router and activate it again. You should see that the datak9 license is installed and active on your router.
  
Third, you can try to reboot your router by entering the following command:

    Router# reload

This will restart your router and reload the configuration and licenses. Sometimes this can fix some issues with the features or performance of your router.
