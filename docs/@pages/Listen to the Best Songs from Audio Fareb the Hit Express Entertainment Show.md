The movie begins with Dr. Rohit Verma (Faraaz Khan), a successful cardiologist, who is happily married to his wife Neha (Suman Ranganathan). Their life takes a turn when they meet Inspector Dhanraj (Milind Gunaji), who saves them from a robbery. Dhanraj becomes obsessed with Neha, and starts to stalk and harass her. He also tries to create a rift between Rohit and Neha, by planting doubts and lies in their minds. He even goes to the extent of killing Rohit's friend and framing him for the murder.

He shows his range of emotions, from happiness to anger to fear, with ease. Suman Ranganathan, who also made her debut with this movie, plays the role of the innocent wife who is trapped in Dhanraj's web of lies. She portrays her character's vulnerability and strength with grace. Milind Gunaji is the highlight of the movie, as he plays the role of the psychotic cop who is obsessed with Neha. He brings out the menace and madness of his character with perfection, and makes him a formidable villain.

The movie was also compared unfavorably with its Hollywood counterpart, Unlawful Entry. However, the movie was successful at the box office for its budget, and has gained a cult following over the years.
